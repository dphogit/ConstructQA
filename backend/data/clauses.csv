(c) 5 years if: (i) the building elements (including services, linings, renewable protective coatings, and fixtures) are easy to access and replace, and (ii) failure of those building elements to comply with the building code would be easily detected during normal use of the building. Performance B2.3.1 applies from the time of issue of the applicable code compliance certificate. Building elements are not required to satisfy a durability performance which exceeds the specified intended life of the building."
Stability,Durability,B2.3.2,"Individual building elements which are components of a building system and are difficult to access or replace must either: (a) all have the same durability, or (b) be installed in a manner that permits the replacement of building elements of lesser durability without removing building elements that have greater durability and are not specifically designed for removal and replacement."
B2/VM1,Durability Evaluation,1.0.1,"Verification that the durability of a building element complies with the NZBC B2.3.1 and B2.3.2 will be by proof of performance and shall take into account the expected in-service exposure conditions by one or more of the following: a) In-service history, b) Laboratory testing, c) Comparable performance of similar building elements."

B2/VM1,Similar materials,1.3.1,"For the purposes of evaluation, a building element may be considered as similar to another building element with proven performance, if both are subject to the same controls for composition and overall performance. Examples of such controls are Approved Documents or Standards. Where such a direct comparison is not possible, the building element shall be independently assessed to determine the degree of similarity."
B2/VM1,Similar materials,1.3.2,"Assessment shall take into account but not be limited to: a) Product composition, b) Method and quality assurance of manufacture, c) Degradation mechanisms, d) Local environment, e) Conditions of use, f) Required maintenance, and g) Performance in use."

A 15 year durability is required. c) Easy to access and replace – applies to building elements where access or replacement involves little alteration or removal of other building elements. Examples are linings, trim, light fittings, hotwater cylinder elements and door hardware, or where specific provision for removal has been made. A 5 year durability is required. d) Failure to comply with the NZBC would go undetected during both normal use and maintenance of the building – applies where the building elements are hidden from view with no provision for inspection access, and failure would not be apparent until significant damage had occurred to other building elements. Examples are building paper behind a masonry veneer cladding, and insulation in a skillion roof. A 50 year durability is required. e) Failure to comply with the NZBC would go undetected during normal use of the building but would be easily detected during normal maintenance – applies where normal maintenance will identify faults unlikely to be observed by building occupants until significant damage has occurred. Examples are degradation of exterior claddings on roofs and walls, sealant filled joints, flashings, services with specific provision for inspection access, chimneys and flues. A 15 year durability is required. f) Failure to comply with the NZBC would be easily detected during normal use of the building – applies where the failure is obvious to the building occupants. Examples are exposed building elements which are damaged or inoperative such as protective finishes, essential signs, sticking doors, slip resistant surfaces, stair treads and surface-run building services equipment. A 5 year durability is required."

It covers buildings or parts of buildings where people: a) Sleep (SM), and b) Are unable to self-evacuate without assistance through requiring special care or treatment, or they are restrained, or their liberties are restricted (SI), and c) Congregate, participate in group activities or where professional services or retail are provided (CA), and d) Work (WB), and e) Store goods and other materials (WS), and f) Park vehicles (VP). These activities are described in Table 1.1."
C/AS2,Introduction and scope,1.1.2,"Buildings with complex features are outside the scope of this Acceptable Solution. Complex features include: a) Atriums, and b) Intermediate floors, other than limited area intermediate floors, and c) Operating theatres, intensive care units, hyperbaric chambers, delivery rooms, and recovery rooms (SI), and d) Recreation and event centres (with tiered seating for more than 2000 people) (CA), and e) Buildings more than 20 storeys high, and f) Prison buildings. Buildings that have features for which solutions are not provided within this Acceptable Solution are also deemed to be complex."
C/AS2,Introduction and scope,1.1.3,"If the Acceptable Solution cannot be followed in full, use Verification Method C/VM2 or an alternative solution to demonstrate compliance."
C/AS2,Introduction and scope,1.1.4,"Other than where permitted for risk group SI and for early childhood centres, this Acceptable Solution allows for an ‘all out’ evacuation strategy. It does not provide features to facilitate a delayed evacuation strategy."
C/AS2,Introduction and scope,1.1.5,"Risk group SI invariably requires a fire safety strategy involving delayed initiation of evacuation and movement to a place of safety within the building. However, this Acceptable Solution does not provide for building features that would be required for a stay-in-place strategy. This applies to activities such as: a) Operating theatres, and b) Intensive care units, and c) Hyperbaric chambers, and d) Delivery rooms, and e) Recovery rooms."
C/AS2,Introduction and scope,1.1.6,"This Acceptable Solution does not provide for any use, storage or processing of hazardous substances. Compliance with NZBC Clause F3, the Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act 1996, and the Health and Safety at Work (Hazardous Substances) Regulations 2017 shall also be ensured where applicable in addition to the requirements of this Acceptable Solution."
C/AS2,Using this Acceptable Solution,1.2.1,"The process for using this Acceptable Solution shall be as follows. Step 1: Determine which risk group applies—a) Determine the risk group for each of the activities carried out in the building (refer to Table 1.1 and Paragraph 1.1.1). If the activity is not listed explicitly, choose the nearest suitable risk group. b) If there is more than one risk group for a firecell, determine its primary risk group (see Paragraph 1.2.2: this is the one with the most onerous fire safety requirements). c) Apply this Acceptable Solution for any firecell by following steps 2 and 3. d) Then apply the relevant parts of this Acceptable Solution for firecells. Step 2: Determine the parameters for the various risk groups—a) Establish the relevant building measurements (these will include building height, floor area, wall openings and distances to relevant boundaries). b) Work out the occupant loads for the relevant occupied spaces (refer to Paragraph 1.4). Step 3: Satisfy the fire safety requirements Satisfy the fire safety requirements of this Acceptable Solution (refer to Parts 2-7), based on the occupant loads and on the building’s dimensions and features where required."
C/AS2,Using this Acceptable Solution,1.2.2,"If a building contains a number of different activities which individually may be categorised in different risk groups, the risk group designated for a particular firecell within a building shall be that of the primary risk group. The primary risk group shall be that one within the firecell that has the most onerous fire safety requirements. Other risk groups may be able to be incorporated within the same space provided these are ancillary to, and support, the primary risk groups."
C/AS2,Using this Acceptable Solution,1.2.3,"Depending on the particular building and the uses or activities within that building, there may be several primary risk groups, with one or more on each floor."
C/AS2,Alterations to buildings,1.3.1,This Acceptable Solution may be used to determine the compliance of building work (in relation to an existing building).
C/AS2,Calculating occupant loads,1.4.1,"The occupant load shall be determined from the risk group and number of people in each space of the building. The occupant load may need to be evaluated not only for each risk group but also for: a) A space or open floor area involving one or more activities, and b) A floor containing more than one risk group, and c) A single firecell, and d) Each floor within a firecell."
C/AS2,Calculating occupant loads,1.4.2,"Occupant loads shall be calculated from the occupant densities given in Table 1.2 based on the floor area of the part of the building housing the activity. The occupant densities in Table 1.2 already allow for a proportion of the floor area appropriate to the activity being occupied by furniture, partitions, fixtures and associated equipment. If a building space has alternative activity uses, the activity having the greatest occupant density shall be used. If an activity is not specifically described in Table 1.2, the nearest reasonable description shall be used."
C/AS2,Calculating occupant loads,1.4.3,"Duplication shall be avoided by: a) Ensuring that, where people may be involved in more than one activity, they are counted only once, and b) Not including an occupant load for exitways, or for the occupant load determined for areas such as lift lobbies or sanitary facilities that are used intermittently by people already counted elsewhere in the building."
C/AS2,Calculating occupant loads,1.4.4,"Occupant load assessment shall take account of the actual arrangement and number of seats for fixed seating (see Paragraph 3.7.4). Where additional floor area abuts the fixed seating, additional occupants are permitted in that floor area based on standing space density, provided the escape route is not obstructed."
C/AS2,Calculating occupant loads,1.4.5,The requirements of this Acceptable Solution account for the fact that other people may be present in the building or firecell and additional calculations are not required when an occupant load is derived by bed spaces (i.e. for risk groups SM and SI)
C/AS2,Calculating occupant loads,1.4.6,"For the purposes of risk group SI the term ‘bed’ means the number of people that are under care or detention. It can include people on: a) Beds, or b) Recliner or lounge chairs, or c) Dentist chairs, or d) Treatment tables, or e) Any other furniture where an occupant may be for a period of treatment, in care or detention."
C/AS2,Calculating occupant loads,1.4.7,"If, in a particular situation, the occupant load derived from Table 1.2 is clearly more than that which will occur, the basis of any proposal for a lesser occupant load shall be substantiated to the building consent authority"
C/AS2,Calculating occupant loads,1.4.8,"If the maximum occupant load is greater than that calculated from Table 1.2, the higher number shall be used as the basis for the fire safety design and will need to be justified to the building consent authority."

A direct connection to Fire and Emergency New Zealand is not required if automatic heat or smoke detection systems are provided in addition to the systems required by this Acceptable Solution."
C/AS2,Fire safety systems,2.2.2,"In addition to Paragraph 2.2.1, the fire safety systems required for firecells in early childhood centres shall be as follows: a) In single storey early childhood centres, dedicated sleeping areas shall be protected with supplementary smoke detectors. The alarm system and any smoke detection system shall comply with NZS 4512. b) Where the escape height of the early childhood centre is greater than 2.0 m: i) a Type 7 system shall be installed throughout the building, and ii) at least two separate places of safety shall be provided, and iii) each place of safety shall be separated with fire separations designed to the property rating and have direct access to a safe path or final exit"
C/AS2,Fire safety systems,2.2.3,"Where there is more than one firecell the following design sequence shall be used to determine the fire safety systems for other firecells in the building (see Figure 2.1). Step 1 Determine the risk groups associated with each firecell within the building (refer Table 1.1 and Paragraphs 1.2.1 and 1.2.2). Step 2 Determine the escape height in metres of each firecell. Step 3 Determine the occupant load for each firecell in accordance with Paragraph 1.4. Step 4 Taking into consideration the notes within Tables 2.2a, 2.2b, 2.2c and 2.2d and Paragraph 2.2.2 determine the fire safety systems required to protect each risk group. Step 5 For each risk group, insert the fire safety system ascertained in Step 4 into Table 2.3 column 1 and determine the fire safety system for the other risk groups in the building from Table 2.3 column 2."
C/AS2,Fire safety systems,2.2.4,"For risk group VP firecells that require a fire sprinkler system (refer to Table 2.2d), the fire sprinkler system does not need to be extended throughout the remainder of the building where the risk group VP firecells are fire separated from the adjacent firecells. The fire separation between adjacent firecells is required to be provided with the greater of the property rating of the adjacent firecells (refer to Table 2.4). Step 6 Based on the fire safety systems ascertained in Step 5, determine the most onerous requirements from Tables 2.2a, 2.2b, 2.2c, 2.2d and 2.3."
C/AS2,Fire safety systems,2.2.5,"If there is more than one risk group on one floor level, the fire safety requirements will depend on whether the risk groups occupy the same firecell, or whether the floor is divided by fire separations into different firecells."
C/AS2,Fire safety systems,2.2.6,"Where fire separations are not needed between different risk groups on the same floor level, the fire safety systems adopted for the firecell shall be those of the primary risk group (as defined in Paragraph 1.2.2)."
C/AS2,Fire safety systems,2.2.7,"Where firecells containing the same risk group occur at different levels in the same building, the fire safety systems for the firecell having the most onerous requirements shall be applied to all firecells of that risk group."
C/AS2,Fire safety systems,2.2.8,The alarm systems required in a building shall be configured to alert all building occupants in the event of fire. This does not apply to the activation of the local smoke detection component of a Type 5 system.
C/AS2,Fire safety systems,2.2.9,In risk group SI alerting all building occupants in the event of fire is not required where it is deemed appropriate to alert management and staff without notifying other occupants.
